No frequency response data for 200 kHz transducer. There was an error that I could not rectify:
"The TS frequency response for pings in 'Fileset 1:TS pulse compressed wideband pings T2' are not directly comparable since the calibration data differs betweenpings.

I think the error might stem from wideband frequency select was from 160-260kHz (should be 170-260). I attempted to wideband ping subset back to 170 but still was unable to export the frequency response for the 200kHz transducer
