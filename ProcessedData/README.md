All data in this folder needs to be created locally and should not be added to the repo (see note re: large file sizes).

Data is generated by running:

``` r
source('Analysis_Scripts/read_tidy_export_EVfiles.R')
```

This will generate:
- *processed_AllFishCombined_unfiltered.csv*
- *processed_AllFishCombined_unfiltered.Rdata*
- *processed_AnalysisData.csv*
- *processed_AnalysisData.Rdata*

Loading the modelling data from *processed_AnalysisData.Rdata* is the preferred method as it will load a tibble called *processed_data* and avoids any potential changes in variable types that may be introduced from `read.csv` or `readr::read_csv`.

``` r
load("ProcessedData/processed_AnalysisData.Rdata")
processed_data
```
